## Project Description:

<br>
<br>

## Tech Used:

<br>

### Front End:
The front-end is entirely built from flask rendered jinja templates that contain vanilla **HTML, CSS, and Javscript**. There are plans to port this all over to REACT.js once I get around to learning the framework.

<br>

### Back End:
The backend is all built with Pythons' **Flask** web framework, which has **Plottly Dash** attached to it as well. You can view the requirements.txt file for a list of all third-party tools being used.

<br>

### Database:
At the current moment, in order to allow for faster development and pivotting **MongoDB** is being used. There might be plans to utilize mongo more as a cache and transitition data over to a SQL based database in the future, once schemas and functionality is ironed out.

<br>

### Production Infrastructure:
In production, the application is containerized and run by a **Gunicorn** server which sits behind an **Nginx** proxy server. 

At the moment, the mongo database that is being used is hosted with Mongo Atlas.
